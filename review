                    <h3>Comedy</h3>
                    <p>This movie is insanely funny. Wade makes a joke in almost every scene. The jokes are just cheesy, stupid jokes. The jokes were very funny. Deadpool is the funniest movie I have ever seen.</p>

                    <h3>Review</h3>
                    <p>I would recomend this movie to anyone old enough to see Deadpool. It has great picture, funny jokes, and a great plot. I would rate the movie 10/10, any day. Of course, I would not recommend anyone not mature enough to see the movie because of its rating. Overall, amazing movie.</p>
